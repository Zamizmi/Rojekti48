All of us are well aware of the heroic epics of days gone by: How the stalwart warriors fought bravely in wars against those of similar skill, in honourable ways and equipent much alike. In these battles humans, elves, dwarves and other heroic defenders of home and country clashed ferociuosly against invading goblins, trolls and orcs. But that is not what we are here for!

No, the winds of change have blown. These days the first reaction one has to an Orc is not to stab them (at least it should not be), as they have been accepted to live among us like any other. All it took was a scholar who bothered trying to learn their language! However, not everyone is happy with this change (something about racial pride) and small fights break out every now and then. And that is what is happening right here!

With the changing times, so have changed the fights. No longer do we care for honour, skill in particular or having matching equipment. Noooo, we have gone to full on arms race! The Orc and Dwarf that got mad at each other in a nearby bar have decided to settle their dispute on the ever hanging grounds of Dakkathon, where both contestants are given a gun, the true weapon of these ages, and a steady stream of robots to destroy to empower themselves. May the best humanoid win!
